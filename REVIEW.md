# Review

## General
- Move dev libraries to requirements-dev.txt inheriting from requirements.txt

```
-r requirements.txt

pylint..
black..
etc
```

- Usually good to add suffix View for views, Form for forms
- Add tests
- Use more inheritance to reuse templates instead of copy/pasting html structure
